## About

This project is a part of the ALX School System Engineering & DevOps curriculum. It focuses on advanced API concepts, including pagination, recursion, and authentication, using the Reddit API as a case study.

## Contents

1. **0-subs.py**: Python script that queries the Reddit API and returns the number of subscribers for a given subreddit.
2. **1-top_ten.py**: Python script that queries the Reddit API and prints the titles of the first 10 hot posts listed for a given subreddit.
3. **2-recurse.py**: Python script that recursively queries the Reddit API and returns a list containing the titles of all hot articles for a given subreddit.
4. **100-count.py**: Python script that queries the Reddit API, parses the title of all hot articles, and prints a sorted count of given keywords.
5. **101-sentiment.py**: Python script that queries the Reddit API, analyzes the sentiment of the titles of hot articles for a given subreddit, and prints the sentiment score.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mwanikigachanja/alx-system_engineering-devops.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd alx-system_engineering-devops/0x16-api_advanced
   ```

3. Run the desired Python script, passing the required arguments as needed.

## Usage

Each Python script in this project can be run independently. You can execute them from the command line and follow the prompts to provide any required input or arguments.

Example:

```
python3 0-subs.py programming
```

This command will query the Reddit API to retrieve the number of subscribers for the "programming" subreddit.
