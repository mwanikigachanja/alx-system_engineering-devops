## Overview
This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of HTTPS and SSL/TLS protocols. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of HTTP, the protocol used to transmit data between a web server and a web browser. HTTPS ensures that the data exchanged between the server and the browser is encrypted, providing confidentiality and integrity.
