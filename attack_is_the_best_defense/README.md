GitHub Repository: [attack_is_the_best_defense](https://github.com/mwanikigachanja/attack_is_the_best_defense)

## Overview

The "Attack is the Best Defense" project explores the concept of ethical hacking and penetration testing. The tasks within this project focus on identifying vulnerabilities in a simulated network environment and exploiting them to enhance security measures.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- Understanding common network vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
- Practicing ethical hacking techniques to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.
- Learning how to secure systems by understanding potential attack vectors.

## Tasks Overview

1. **Steal the Key**: This task involves deploying a custom Nmap script to scan a web server for open ports and services, and then exploiting a vulnerability to retrieve a hidden file containing a secret key.

2. **Access the Secret Token**: In this task, a vulnerable version of the `vsftpd` service is exploited to gain access to a file containing a secret token.

3. **Find a Password**: The task involves exploiting a weakly secured WordPress installation to gain access to a user's password.

## Usage

Each task contains specific instructions and scripts to perform the required actions. To use the provided scripts:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mwanikigachanja/attack_is_the_best_defense.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory of the task you want to perform:

   ```bash
   cd attack_is_the_best_defense/TASK_DIRECTORY
   ```

3. Follow the instructions provided in the README file of the respective task directory to execute the necessary commands and scripts.

## Requirements

- Basic understanding of networking concepts and Linux command-line usage.
- Familiarity with ethical hacking principles and tools such as Nmap, Metasploit, etc.
- Ensure that you have permission to perform penetration testing on the target systems.

## Support

For any issues or suggestions related to this project, feel free to open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mwanikigachanja/attack_is_the_best_defense). Pull requests are also welcome for proposed changes or improvements.
