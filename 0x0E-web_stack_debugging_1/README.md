# Project: 0x0E-web_stack_debugging_1

## Description
This project is part of the ALX System Engineering & DevOps curriculum. It focuses on web stack debugging, specifically troubleshooting and fixing issues with an Nginx installation.

## Tasks
### 0. Nginx likes port 80
Using debugging skills, identify and resolve the issue preventing Nginx from listening on port 80. Write a Bash script to automate the fix.

Requirements:
- Nginx must be running and listening on port 80 of all the server’s active IPv4 IPs.
- Write a Bash script that configures a server to the above requirements.

### 1. Make it sweet and short (Advanced)
Building on task 0, make the fix concise and efficient. Write a Bash script that is 5 lines long or less, respects standard Bash script requirements, and does not use specific constructs. Ensure that the `service` command reports that Nginx is not running after the script is executed.

## Setup
