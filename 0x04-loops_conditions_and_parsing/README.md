6. **Decode the SMS**: This task involves writing a Bash script that decodes a specific SMS encoding format.

7. **Is That a Number?**: A Bash script is created to validate whether a given input is a number or not.

8. **Let's Parse Apache Logs**: This task requires writing a Bash script to extract useful information from Apache logs.

9. **Dig the Data**: In this task, a Python script is created to parse specific data from given input.

## Usage

Each task contains a script file named according to the task number, such as `0-low_hanging_fruit`, `1-for_holberton_school`, etc. To use these scripts:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mwanikigachanja/0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory of the task you want to run:

   ```bash
   cd 0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing
   ```

3. Make the script file executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x SCRIPT_NAME
   ```

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./SCRIPT_NAME
   ```

Replace `SCRIPT_NAME` with the name of the script file you want to execute.

## Requirements

- These scripts are designed to be run on Unix-like systems.
- Ensure that you have appropriate permissions to execute the scripts.
