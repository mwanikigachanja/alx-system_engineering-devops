# Web Stack Debugging 2

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on debugging issues within a web stack environment.

## Description

The purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience in debugging web server-related issues. In this project, we'll encounter scenarios where a web server is not responding as expected or is encountering errors. Our task is to identify the root cause of the issue and implement the necessary fixes to restore the proper functionality of the web server.

## Files

- **0-iamsomeonelese**: Bash script to run Apache as another user.
- **1-run_nginx_as_nginx**: Bash script to run Nginx as the `nginx` user rather than `root`.
- **2-replace_nginx_config**: Bash script to fix a broken Nginx configuration file.
- **README.md**: This README file providing an overview of the project.
