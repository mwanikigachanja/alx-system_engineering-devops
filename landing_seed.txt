To create a landing page for the app, we can use Streamlit's built-in layout features to design a visually appealing and informative page that provides an overview of the app's functionality and features. Here's how we can do it:

```python
import streamlit as st

# Page title and description
st.title("Seed Insight App")
st.write("Welcome to the Seed Insight App! This app helps you explore maize varieties, companies, and eco-zones.")

# Features section
st.header("Features")
st.markdown("""
- Explore different maize varieties and their attributes.
- View information about companies and their specialties.
- Learn about various eco-zones and their characteristics.
- Register new companies, maize varieties, and eco-zones.
- Dynamic CRUD operations for managing data.

# How to use section

This code creates a simple landing page with sections for features, how to use instructions, and information about the app. You can customize the content and styling further based on your preferences and requirements. Additionally, you can add images, logos, or additional sections to enhance the landing page further.
