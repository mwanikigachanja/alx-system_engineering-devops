**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:** 
  - Outage occurred from 9:00 AM to 11:30 AM on March 15, 2024 (UTC timezone).

- **Impact:** 
  - The outage affected the company's main e-commerce website, resulting in a complete service downtime for approximately 30% of users. Users experienced slow loading times and intermittent errors during the outage.

- **Root Cause:** 
  - The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing it to become overloaded and unable to distribute traffic effectively.

**Timeline:**

- **9:00 AM:** 
  - Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a spike in server response times.

- **9:15 AM:** 
  - Engineers began investigating the issue, initially focusing on the database servers due to previous performance issues.

- **9:45 AM:** 
  - Assumption made that the database servers were the cause of the slowdown, leading to further investigation in that direction.

- **10:30 AM:** 
  - Despite optimizations made to the database servers, the issue persisted. It was then discovered that the load balancer was not distributing traffic evenly.

- **11:00 AM:** 
  - Incident escalated to the DevOps team for immediate action.

- **11:30 AM:** 
  - Load balancer settings were corrected, and traffic distribution normalized, resolving the issue.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- **Root Cause:** 
  - The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused it to direct an overwhelming amount of traffic to certain servers, resulting in performance degradation.

- **Resolution:** 
  - The issue was resolved by adjusting the load balancer settings to evenly distribute traffic across all available servers. Additionally, monitoring thresholds were updated to alert engineers earlier in case of similar incidents in the future.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement automated testing for load balancer configurations to catch potential misconfigurations before they impact the system.
  - Conduct regular audits of load balancer settings to ensure they align with current traffic patterns and server capacities.

- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Patch the load balancer configuration to prevent overloading of individual servers.
  - Implement automated monitoring for load balancer performance and traffic distribution.
  - Conduct a thorough review of system configurations to identify and address any other potential misconfigurations that could lead to similar incidents.

By addressing the root cause of the outage and implementing preventative measures, the team aims to minimize the risk of similar incidents in the future and ensure the stability and reliability of the company's services.
