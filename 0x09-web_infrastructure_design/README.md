# Web Infrastructure Design Project (0x09)

## Overview

Welcome to the Web Infrastructure Design project for the ALX System Engineering & DevOps curriculum. This project focuses on creating a detailed design for a web infrastructure based on specified requirements.

## Repository

This repository contains the following:

- **Diagrams**: This directory includes visual representations of the web infrastructure design using tools like draw.io or any other diagramming tool of your choice.

- **README.md**: You are currently reading the main documentation file, providing an overview of the project and its contents.

## Project Requirements

1. **Web Server**: Design a scalable and reliable web server architecture to handle the anticipated traffic and provide high availability.

2. **Application Server**: Create a robust application server setup to host the web application, ensuring efficient handling of requests and fault tolerance.

3. **Database Server**: Design the database server architecture, considering data storage, redundancy, and backups to ensure data integrity and availability.

4. **Network Topology**: Define the network topology that connects different components of the infrastructure, including security measures and data flow.

## Diagrams

Find visual representations of the web infrastructure design in the "Diagrams" directory. These diagrams illustrate the architecture, connections, and flow of data in the system.
