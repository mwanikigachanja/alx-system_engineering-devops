# 0x0D-web_stack_debugging_0

## Overview

This project is focused on learning and practicing debugging techniques in web server environments. Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing issues or errors in software applications or systems. In this project, we will debug a web server configuration to resolve issues and ensure its proper functionality.

## Project Goals

- Learn debugging techniques for web server environments.
- Identify and fix common issues in web server configurations.
- Understand the importance of troubleshooting and problem-solving skills in system administration.
- Gain hands-on experience with system-level debugging tools and commands.

## Project Structure

The project typically involves the following tasks:

1. **Issue Identification**: Analyze the symptoms and behavior of the web server to identify the underlying issue(s).

2. **Debugging**: Use system-level debugging tools and commands to diagnose the problem and identify its root cause.

3. **Issue Resolution**: Implement the necessary changes to the web server configuration to resolve the identified issue(s).

## Requirements

- Basic understanding of web server configuration (e.g., Nginx, Apache).
- Familiarity with Linux command-line interface (CLI) and system administration.
- Knowledge of common web server issues and their causes.
- Understanding of system-level debugging tools and commands (e.g., strace, lsof, netstat).

## Getting Started

To get started with the project:

1. Reproduce the issue(s) with the web server (e.g., failing to start, serving incorrect content).
2. Use system-level debugging tools and commands to analyze the web server's behavior and identify the root cause of the issue(s).
3. Make the necessary changes to the web server configuration to resolve the identified problem(s).
4. Test the web server to ensure that the issue(s) have been successfully resolved.
